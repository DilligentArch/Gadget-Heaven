## Key React Concepts Applied
- **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: Utilized to blend HTML-like syntax within JavaScript, streamlining the UI structure.
- **Components**: The application comprises reusable, modular functional components, each representing a unique aspect of the UI.
- **State Management (`useState`)**: Manages local component state, enabling dynamic responses to user actions.
- **Effect Hook (`useEffect`)**: Handles side effects, such as API requests, ensuring the UI updates based on external data.
- **Event Handling**: Employs Reactâ€™s synthetic event system to manage user inputs like clicks and form actions.
- **React Router**: Facilitates smooth page transitions within the SPA framework, enhancing user experience.
- **`useNavigate`**: Supports programmatic navigation, directing users based on their interactions.
- **`useParams`**: Fetches URL parameters to display unique content, such as individual gadget details.
- **`NavLink`**: Provides styled navigation links with active-state styling to improve usability.

## Data Management Strategy
Gadget Haven uses local storage to persist shopping cart and wishlist data, enhancing user convenience by maintaining these lists across sessions. Key functions include:
- **Retrieving Saved Items**: Functions retrieve cart and wishlist items from local storage, allowing users to resume browsing without losing saved selections.
- **Adding Items**: Functions add gadgets to the cart or wishlist, checking for duplicates to prevent redundant entries. If an item already exists, a toast notification informs the user.
- **Removing Items**: Functions delete items from the cart or wishlist, updating local storage accordingly.

## Key Features
- **Browse Gadgets**: Users can explore a broad range of gadgets, organized by category, with each item displaying detailed specifications.
- **Favorite Gadgets**: A heart icon allows users to save gadgets to a favorites list for easy access and comparison.
- **Detailed Gadget Pages**: Each gadget has a dedicated page featuring high-quality images and in-depth descriptions.
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear navigation facilitates seamless movement across the platform.
- **Efficient Checkout**: Users can add items to their cart and proceed to checkout, ensuring a smooth purchasing experience.
